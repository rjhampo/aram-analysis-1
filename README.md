# League of Legends ARAM Analysis 1
Effect of Player Rank on ARAM Match Winrate

ARAM is an All Random All Mid game mode in the game League of Legends where players play random champions and fight in one area (usually a lane). In this game mode, victory is volatile as the randomness and tight game area create more fights and likely comebacks. Yet in this game, there are players who are placed in different ranks determined from the Ranked game mode where the pace is more standard compared to ARAM. Hence, it's possible player rank (which translate to player skill) may have an influence on winning in ARAM. Hence, this project aims to uncover the relationship between player rank and ARAM match winrate. This will help players gauge the situation on a game if their opponents have an advantage (coming from LoL game tools).
